mk_listbydate is a very simple TYPO3 extension that allows to display a list
of entries by date. The entries must be edited in the backend list-view.

The recurring dates can be set as:
 * Day of month e.g. the 11th of every month
 * e.g. Every monday of the first week of the month or the last Sunday of the month
